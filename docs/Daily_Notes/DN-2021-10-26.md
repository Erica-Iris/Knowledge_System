### revenant

#### define:

#### origin

Revenant “a person who returns as a spirit after death” is a direct borrowing from French, in which the word is a present participle meaning “coming back, returning.” The infinitive, revenir, is a combination of the prefix re- “back, again” and venir “to come,” the latter from Latin venīre, of the same meaning. Venīre is the source of English terms such as adventure, avenue, convenient, eventual, and invention, all of which originally related to movement, gathering, or discovery (i.e., coming across something); the Latin verb derives from the same Proto-Indo-European root, gwā- “to go, come,” that gives us come, become, welcome, and the Ancient Greek-derived terms acrobat and basis (from baínein). Revenant was first recorded in English in the 1820s.

Revenant“死后灵魂归来的人”直接借用法语，该词是现在分词，意思是“归来，归来”。不定式revenir 是前缀re-“back, again”和venir“to come”的组合，后者来自拉丁文venīre，意思相同。 Venīre 是诸如冒险、大道、便利、最终和发明等英语术语的来源，所有这些术语最初都与运动、聚集或发现（即遇到某事）有关；拉丁语动词源自同一个原始印欧语词根 gwā-“to go, come”，它赋予我们来、成为、欢迎，以及源自古希腊语的术语 acrobat 和基础（来自 baínein）。 Revenant 于 1820 年代首次以英文录制。
